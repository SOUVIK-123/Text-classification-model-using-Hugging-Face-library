The task is to build a text classification model using the Hugging Face library to classify a
given dataset of text into multiple categories, where the dataset should have at least 1000
samples for each category. The candidate should preprocess the text data by cleaning it,
removing stopwords, punctuations and other irrelevant characters. Then, they should
fine-tune a pre-trained model such as BERT or GPT-2 on the classification task using the
transformers library in Python. The model should be trained and evaluated using metrics
such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Finally, the trained model should be used
to predict the categories of a few samples from the test set.
