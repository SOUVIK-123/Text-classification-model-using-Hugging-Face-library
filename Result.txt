The model achieves an accuracy of 91% on the test set, which is a decent
performance, but there is still room for improvement. One possible way to improve
the model's performance is to use a larger dataset for training to help the model

generalize better to new data. Data augmentation techniques, such as rotating or
flipping the images, can also be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset.
